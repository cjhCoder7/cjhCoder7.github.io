        LLMs have demonstrated proficiency in handling single-task scenarios such as single-file code generation and project-level code completion. However, there is a notable research gap in zero-shot generation of entire projects. The research objective is to construct a benchmark dataset for project-level code generation and explore more efficient methodologies for generating code at the project level.
