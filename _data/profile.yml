  <p>
    I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Technology at Beihang University, studying at the Top-Notch Computer Talent Program, School of Advanced Technology and Engineering.
  </p>
  <p>
    My research direction is at the intersection of <strong>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</strong> and <strong>Software Engineering (SE)</strong>, including:
    <ul>
      <li>AI for Code Generation, enhancing code generation using large language models (LLMs), including function-level code generation and project-level code generation.</li> 
      <li>LLM Acceleration, improving LLM inference speed by using methods such as speculative decoding, retrieval and copy.</li> 
    </ul>
